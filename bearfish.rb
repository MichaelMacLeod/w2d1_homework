### Objects working together
# When bears are initialized give them an empty 'food' array instance variable.

# Allow the bear to 'take_fish_from' the river.  Taking a fish from the river should remove it from the river fishes array and add it to the bear's food array.

# Note:  Array.pop may come in useful here

# Note: How we do we show/test that the fish has moved from the river's fishes to the bear's food?
# ( .inspect reveals a human readable string for an object )
